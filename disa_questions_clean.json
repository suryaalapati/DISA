In general, CRC can detect all single-bit  and bubble-bit errors. Parity check (known as vertical redundancy check) also involves  adding a bit (known as the parity bit) to each character during transmission. In this  case, where there is a presence of bursts of errors (i.e., impulsing noise during high  transmission rates), it has a reliability of approximately 50 percent. In higher  transmission rates, this limitation is significant. Echo checks detect line errors by  retransmitting data to the sending device for comparison with the original transmission.",

Based on  Media Access Control (MAC) addresses, layer 2 switches separate traffic in a port as  different segments and without determining if it is authorized or unauthorized traffic. A  virtual LAN (VLAN) is a functionality of some switches that allows them to switch the  traffic between different ports as if they are in the same LAN.

This is called a tempest attack, taken from the code name of the first secret  project in which such an interception was studied. These weak signals can be radiated  and intercepted with the proper equipment or transmitted, for example, via power leads.  The signals fade rapidly as distance increases. The first line of defense is to create a  physical security zone (PSZ) to keep receivers at a distance. They can cause health  disorders, such as headaches and diseases; however, no studies have confirmed that  these risks are higher than those posed by the natural radiation found in certain zones  (e.g., mountain areas).

Using statistical  sampling, an IS auditor can quantify how closely the sample should represent the  population and quantify the probability of error. Sampling risk is the risk that incorrect  assumptions will be made about the characteristics of a population from which a sample  is selected. Assuming there are no related compensating controls, inherent risk is the  risk that an error exists, which could be material or significant when combined with  other errors found during the audit. Statistical sampling will not minimize this. Control  risk is the risk that a material error exists, which will not be prevented or detected on a  timely basis by the system of internal controls. This cannot be minimized using  statistical sampling.",

Relational integrity  tests are performed at the record level and usually involve calculating and verifying  various calculated fields, such as control totals. Referential integrity tests involve  ensuring that all references to a primary key from another file actually exist in their  original file. A parity check is a bit added to each character prior to transmission. The  parity bit is a function of the bits making up the character.

Because large databases are indexed, independent indexes must  also be partitioned to maximize performance. Hashing is a method used for index  partitioning. It associates data to disks based on a hash key. Disk partitioning creates  logical drives on the single disk for better management of the contents. Disk mirroring  uses two identical disks. All operations on the two disks are performed so that each disk  is a mirror image of the other. This provides redundancy in case of failure of one of the  disks. Disk duplexing makes use of more than one disk with two separate controllers  providing redundancy in case of a disk failure or a controller card failure.",

Explanation: Stopping the service and installing the security fix is the safest way to  prevent the worm from spreading. If the service is not stopped, installing the fix is not  the most effective method because the worm continues spreading until the fix becomes  effective. Blocking the protocol on the perimeter does not stop the worm from spreading  to the internal network(s).

The financial institution can check that the  instruction was not intercepted and replayed, and thus, it could prevent crediting the  account three times. Encrypting the hash of the payment instruction with the public key  of the financial institution does not protect replay, it only protects confidentiality and  integrity of the instruction. Encrypting the hash of the payment instruction with the  private key of the instructor ensures integrity of the instruction and nonrepudiation of  the issued instruction. The process of creating a message digest requires applying a  cryptographic hashing algorithm to the entire message. The receiver, upon decrypting  the message digest, will recompute the hash using the same hashing algorithm and  compare the result with what was sent.

Explanation: An offsite information processing facility should have the same amount of  physical control as the originating site. It should not be easily identified from the outside  to prevent intentional sabotage. The offsite facility should not be subject to the same  natural disaster that could affect the originating site and thus should not be located in  proximity of the original site, and the offsite facility should possess the same level of  environmental monitoring and control as the originating site.",

An ROI is computed when there is predictable  savings or revenues that can be compared to the investment needed to realize the  revenues. Amortization is used in a profit and loss statement, not in computing potential  losses. Spending the time needed to define exactly the total amount is normally a wrong  approach.

The stringent implementation, monitoring and enforcing of rules by the  security officer through access control software, and provision for punitive actions for  violation of security rules are also required along with the user's education on the  importance of security.",

    "explanation": "The recovery point objective (RPO) defines the point in time to which data  must be restored after a disaster so as to resume processing transactions. Backups  should be performed in a way that the latest backup is no older than this maximum time  frame. If service levels are not met, the usual consequences are penalty payments, not  cessation of business. Organizations will try to set service level objectives (SLOs) so as  to meet established targets. The resulting time for the service level agreement (SLA)  will usually be longer than the RPO. The recovery time objective (RTO) defines the time  period after the disaster in which normal business functionality needs to be restored.  The maximum acceptable outage (MAO) is the maximum amount of system downtime  that is tolerable. It can be used as a synonym for RTO. However, the RTO denotes an  objective/target, while the MAO constitutes a vital necessity for an organization\u2019s  survival.",

If both of them  are equal, then the block is assumed error free. In this case (such as in parity error or  echo check), multiple errors can be detected. In general, CRC can detect all single-bit  and bubble-bit errors. Parity check (known as vertical redundancy check) also involves  adding a bit (known as the parity bit) to each character during transmission. In this  case, where there is a presence of bursts of errors (i.e., impulsing noise during high  transmission rates), it has a reliability of approximately 50 percent. In higher  transmission rates, this limitation is significant. Echo checks detect line errors by  retransmitting data to the sending device for comparison with the original transmission.",

Relational integrity tests are performed at the record level and usually involve  calculating and verifying various calculated fields, such as control totals. Referential  integrity tests involve ensuring that all references to a primary key from another file  actually exist in their original file. A parity check is a bit added to each character prior to  transmission. The parity bit is a function of the bits making up the character.

Because large databases are indexed, independent indexes must  also be partitioned to maximize performance. Hashing is a method used for index  partitioning. It associates data to disks based on a hash key. Disk partitioning creates  logical drives on the single disk for better management of the contents. Disk mirroring  uses two identical disks. All operations on the two disks are performed so that each disk  is a mirror image of the other. This provides redundancy in case of failure of one of the  disks. Disk duplexing makes use of more than one disk with two separate controllers  providing redundancy in case of a disk failure or a controller card failure.     Mock Assessment Test Paper-7  493",

The financial institution can check that the  instruction was not intercepted and replayed, and thus, it could prevent crediting the  account three times. Encrypting the hash of the payment instruction with the public key  of the financial institution does not protect replay, it only protects confidentiality and  integrity of the instruction. Encrypting the hash of the payment instruction with the  private key of the instructor ensures integrity of the instruction and non-repudiation of  the issued instruction. The process of creating a message digest requires applying a  cryptographic hashing algorithm to the entire message. The receiver, upon decrypting  the message digest, will re-compute the hash using the same hashing algorithm and  compare the result with what was sent.

    "b": "restore application processing after a disruption.",
    "c": "prevent unauthorized changes to programs and data.",
    "d": "ensure recovery of data processing in case of a disaster.",
    "correct": "b",
    "explanation": "restore application processing after a disruption.  Explanation: Backup procedures are designed to restore programs and data to a  previous state prior to computer or system disruption. These backup procedures merely  copy data and do not test or validate integrity. Backup procedures will also not prevent  changes to program and data. On the contrary, changes will simply be copied. Although  backup procedures are a necessary part of the recovery process following a disaster,  they are not sufficient in themselves.",

    "question": "Which of the following findings should an IS auditor be MOST concerned about \nwhen performing an audit of backup and recovery and the offsite storage vault?",
    "a": "There are three individuals with a key to enter the area.",
    "b": "Paper documents are also stored in the offsite vault.",
    "c": "Data files that are stored in the vault are synchronized.",
    "d": "The offsite vault is located in a separate facility.",
    "correct": "c",
    "explanation": "Data files that are stored in the vault are synchronized.  Explanation: Choice A is in because more than one person would typically need to  have a key to the vault to ensure that individuals responsible for the offsite vault can  take vacations and rotate duties. Choice B is not  because the IS auditor would not be  concerned with whether paper documents are stored in the offsite vault. In fact, paper  documents, such as procedural documents and a copy of the contingency plan, would  most likely be stored in the offsite vault, and the location of the vault is important, but  not as important as the files being synchronized.

    "question": "Online banking transactions are being posted to the database when processing \nsuddenly comes to a halt. The integrity of the transaction processing is BEST \nensured by:",
    "a": "database integrity checks.",
    "b": "validation checks.",
    "c": "input controls.",
    "d": "database commits and rollbacks.",
    "correct": "d",
    "explanation": "database commits and rollbacks.  Explanation: Database commits ensure the data are saved to disk, while the  transaction processing is underway or complete. Rollback ensures that the already  completed processing is reversed back, and the data already processed are not saved  to the disk in the event of the failure of the completion of the transaction processing. All  other options do not ensure integrity while processing is underway.",

    "d": "define the retention period.",
    "correct": "a",
    "explanation": "identify the data.  Explanation: Archiving data and backups is essential for the continuity of business.  Selection of the data to be backed up is the first step in the process. Once the data  have been identified, an appropriate retention period, storage media and location can  be selected.",

    "a": "located on a different floor of the building.",
    "b": "easily accessible by everyone.",
    "c": "clearly labeled for emergency access.",
    "d": "protected from unauthorized access.",
    "correct": "d",
    "explanation": "protected from unauthorized access.  Explanation: The offsite storage site should always be protected against unauthorized  accesses and at least have the same security requirements as the primary site. Choice  A is in because, if the backup is in the same building, it may suffer the same event and  may be inaccessible. Choices B and C represent access risks.",
