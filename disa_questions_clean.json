    "option_c": "can be used as a replacement for traditional audits",
    "option_d": "allows management to relinquish responsibility for control.   The correct answer is: A can identify high-risk areas that might need a detailed review  later.   Explanation: CSA is predicated on the review of high-risk areas that either need immediate  attention or a more thorough review at a later date.",
    "answer": "b",
    "explanation": "is incorrect, because CSA  requires the involvement of auditors and line management. What occurs is that the internal  audit function shifts some of the control monitoring responsibilities to the functional areas.  Answer C is incorrect because CSA is not a replacement for traditional audits. CSA is not  intended to replace audit's responsibilities, but to enhance them. Answer D is incorrect,  because CSA does not allow management to relinquish its responsibility for control.",

It compares  the planned amount of work with what has actually been completed, to determine if the  cost, schedule, and work accomplished are progressing in accordance with the plan.  EVA works most effectively if a well-formed work-breakdown structure exists. Function  point analysis (FPA) is an indirect measure of software size and complexity and,  therefore, does not address the elements of time and budget. Cost budgets do not  address time.

The workstations generate the CRC and transmit it with the data. The receiving  workstation computes a CRC and compares it to the transmitted CRC. If both of them  are equal, then the block is assumed error free. In this case (such as in parity error or  echo check), multiple errors can be detected. In general, CRC can detect all single-bit  and bubble-bit errors. Parity check (known as vertical redundancy check) also involves  adding a bit (known as the parity bit) to each character during transmission. In this  case, where there is a presence of bursts of errors (i.e., impulsing noise during high  transmission rates), it has a reliability of approximately 50 percent. In higher  transmission rates, this limitation is significant. Echo checks detect line errors by  retransmitting data to the sending device for comparison with the original transmission.",

The expense would be justified only if the value of the information  to be obtained was high. CRTs can be intercepted, and information obtained can be  from them. This is called a tempest attack, taken from the code name of the first secret  project in which such an interception was studied. These weak signals can be radiated  and intercepted with the proper equipment or transmitted, for example, via power leads.  The signals fade rapidly as distance increases. The first line of defense is to create a  physical security zone (PSZ) to keep receivers at a distance. They can cause health  disorders, such as headaches and diseases; however, no studies have confirmed that  these risks are higher than those posed by the natural radiation found in certain zones  (e.g., mountain areas).

    "answer": "c",
    "explanation": "compliance testing.  Compliance testing determines whether controls are being applied in compliance with  policy. This includes tests to determine whether new accounts were appropriately  authorized. Variable sampling is used to estimate numerical values, such as dollar  values. Substantive testing substantiates the integrity of actual processing, such as  balances on financial statements. The development of substantive tests is often  dependent on the outcome of compliance tests. If compliance tests indicate that there  are adequate internal controls, then substantive tests can be minimized. Stop-or-go  sampling allows a test to be stopped as early as possible and is not appropriate for  checking whether procedures have been followed.",

CSA is predicated on the review of high-risk areas that either need immediate attention  or a more thorough review at a later date. Answer B is incorrect, because CSA requires  the involvement of auditors and line management. What occurs is that the internal audit  function shifts some of the control monitoring responsibilities to the functional areas.  Answer C is incorrect because CSA is not a replacement for traditional audits. CSA is  not intended to replace audit's responsibilities, but to enhance them.

Using statistical  sampling, an IS auditor can quantify how closely the sample should represent the  population and quantify the probability of error. Sampling risk is the risk that incorrect  assumptions will be made about the characteristics of a population from which a sample  is selected. Assuming there are no related compensating controls, inherent risk is the  risk that an error exists, which could be material or significant when combined with  other errors found during the audit. Statistical sampling will not minimize this. Control  risk is the risk that a material error exists, which will not be prevented or detected on a  timely basis by the system of internal controls.

The major objective of this exercise is to  verify that the edit and validation routines are working satisfactorily. Relational integrity  tests are performed at the record level and usually involve calculating and verifying  various calculated fields, such as control totals. Referential integrity tests involve  ensuring that all references to a primary key from another file actually exist in their  original file. A parity check is a bit added to each character prior to transmission. The  parity bit is a function of the bits making up the character.

Because large databases are indexed, independent indexes must  also be partitioned to maximize performance. Hashing is a method used for index  partitioning. It associates data to disks based on a hash key. Disk partitioning creates  logical drives on the single disk for better management of the contents. Disk mirroring  uses two identical disks. All operations on the two disks are performed so that each disk  is a mirror image of the other. This provides redundancy in case of failure of one of the  disks. Disk duplexing makes use of more than one disk with two separate controllers  providing redundancy in case of a disk failure or a controller card failure.",

Explanation: The use of a database administrator (DBA) user account is (should be)  normally set up to log all changes made and is most appropriate for changes made  outside of normal hours. The use of a log, which records the changes, allows changes  to be reviewed. The use of the DBA user account without logging would permit  uncontrolled changes to be made to databases once access to the account was  obtained. The use of a normal user account with no restrictions would allow  uncontrolled changes to any of the databases. Logging would only provide information  on changes made, but would not limit changes to only those that were authorized.

    "explanation": "Affixing a time stamp to the instruction and using it to check  for duplicate payments  Explanation: Affixing a time stamp to the instruction and using it to check for duplicate  payments makes the instruction unique. The financial institution can check that the  instruction was not intercepted and replayed, and thus, it could prevent crediting the  account three times. Encrypting the hash of the payment instruction with the public key  of the financial institution does not protect replay, it only protects confidentiality and  integrity of the instruction. Encrypting the hash of the payment instruction with the  private key of the instructor ensures integrity of the instruction and nonrepudiation of  the issued instruction. The process of creating a message digest requires applying a  cryptographic hashing algorithm to the entire message. The receiver, upon decrypting  the message digest, will recompute the hash using the same hashing algorithm and  compare the result with what was sent.

An ROI is computed when there is predictable  savings or revenues that can be compared to the investment needed to realize the  revenues. Amortization is used in a profit and loss statement, not in computing potential  losses. Spending the time needed to define exactly the total amount is normally a wrong  approach. If it has been difficult to estimate potential losses (e.g., losses derived from  erosion of public image due to a hack attack), that situation is not likely to change, and  at the end of the day, the result will be a not well-supported evaluation.

When network traffic passes the firewall unintentionally, the logical  access controls form a second line of defense. Using two firewalls of different vendors  to consecutively check the incoming network traffic is an example of diversity in  defense. The firewalls are the same security mechanisms. By using two different  products the probability of both products having the same vulnerabilities is diminished.

The difference between incidents and low-level  disasters is always unclear and frequently revolves around the amount of time required  to correct the damage.

    "explanation": "Cyclic redundancy check  DISA AT Mock Test Papers  458  Explanation: The cyclic redundancy check (CRC) can check for a block of transmitted  data. The workstations generate the CRC and transmit it with the data. The receiving  workstation computes a CRC and compares it to the transmitted CRC. If both of them  are equal, then the block is assumed error free. In this case (such as in parity error or  echo check), multiple errors can be detected. In general, CRC can detect all single-bit  and bubble-bit errors. Parity check (known as vertical redundancy check) also involves  adding a bit (known as the parity bit) to each character during transmission. In this  case, where there is a presence of bursts of errors (i.e., impulsing noise during high  transmission rates), it has a reliability of approximately 50 percent. In higher  transmission rates, this limitation is significant. Echo checks detect line errors by  retransmitting data to the sending device for comparison with the original transmission.",

Sampling risk is the risk that in  assumptions will be made about the characteristics of a population from which a sample  is selected. Assuming there are no related compensating controls, inherent risk is the  risk that an error exists, which could be material or significant when combined with  other errors found during the audit. Statistical sampling will not minimize this. Control  risk is the risk that a material error exists, which will not be prevented or detected on a  timely basis by the system of internal controls.

Because large databases are indexed, independent indexes must  also be partitioned to maximize performance. Hashing is a method used for index  partitioning. It associates data to disks based on a hash key. Disk partitioning creates  logical drives on the single disk for better management of the contents. Disk mirroring  uses two identical disks. All operations on the two disks are performed so that each disk  is a mirror image of the other. This provides redundancy in case of failure of one of the  disks. Disk duplexing makes use of more than one disk with two separate controllers  providing redundancy in case of a disk failure or a controller card failure.     Mock Assessment Test Paper-7  493",

    "option_d": "Referential integrity",
    "answer": "d",
    "explanation": "Referential integrity  Explanation: Referential integrity ensures that a foreign key in one table will equal null  or the value of a primary in the other table. For every tuple in a table having a  referenced/foreign key, there should be a corresponding tuple in another table, i.e., for  existence of all foreign keys in the original tables. If this condition is not satisfied, then it  results in a dangling tuple. Cyclical checking is the control technique for the regular  checking of accumulated data on a file against authorized source documentation. There  is no cyclical integrity testing. Domain integrity testing ensures that a data item has a  legitimate value in the  range or set. Relational integrity is performed at the record level  and is ensured by calculating and verifying specific fields.",

Audit log procedures enable  recording of all events that have been identified and help in tracing the events.  However, they only point to the event and do not ensure completeness or accuracy of  the database's contents. Querying/monitoring table access time checks helps designers  improve database performance, but not integrity. Rollback and rollforward database  features ensure recovery from an abnormal disruption.

The use of a log, which records the changes, allows changes  to be reviewed. The use of the DBA user account without logging would permit  uncontrolled changes to be made to databases once access to the account was  obtained.

    "explanation": "atomicity.  Explanation: The principle of atomicity requires that a transaction be completed in its  entirety or not at all. If an error or interruption occurs, all changes made up to that point  are backed out. Consistency ensures that all integrity conditions in the database be  maintained with each transaction. Isolation ensures that each transaction is isolated  from other transactions, and hence, each transaction only accesses data that are part of  a consistent database state. Durability ensures that, when a transaction has been  reported back to a user as complete, the resultant changes to the database will survive  subsequent hardware or software failures.",

    "answer": "b",
    "explanation": "Affixing a time stamp to the instruction and using it to check for  duplicate payments  Explanation: Affixing a time stamp to the instruction and using it to check for duplicate  payments makes the instruction unique. The financial institution can check that the  instruction was not intercepted and replayed, and thus, it could prevent crediting the  account three times. Encrypting the hash of the payment instruction with the public key  of the financial institution does not protect replay, it only protects confidentiality and  integrity of the instruction. Encrypting the hash of the payment instruction with the  private key of the instructor ensures integrity of the instruction and non-repudiation of  the issued instruction. The process of creating a message digest requires applying a  cryptographic hashing algorithm to the entire message. The receiver, upon decrypting  the message digest, will re-compute the hash using the same hashing algorithm and  compare the result with what was sent. Hence, affixing a time stamp into the hash of the  instruction before being digitally signed by the instructor would violate the integrity  requirements of a digital signature.",
